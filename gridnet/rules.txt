- A user can hand-off a Jiyoba to any other user.  If the user isn't already playing it is an invitation.
- A user can invite a user to play by dropping a home base for that user on the map.
- A user can move their home base any time, friends playing will see this.
  On the Jiyoba tab, selecting a Jiyoba pans the user to the Jiyoba and puts a sling on it.<M-D-t_`�>üû!6
- A user can sling a ball from their home base using a sling on the map
- A user can see a list of Jiyoba they possess and choose to put them in their satch. They will only see those in thier satch on their phone.
- If the field allows it, a user can set up auto-bounce which will on their home-base which will always bounce a jiyoba off of their base.... Stewards can turn off the ability to auto-bounce
- A field is divided up into 64 segments that can contain home bases.  Users can share a home base.
- Users can purchase a stewardship to as many fields as they want
- Users can download a free satchel program for their phone and will be able to locate, retrieve and throw any Jiyoba in their vicinity.
- When a Jiyoba is given to a user, another Jiyoba is placed on the map wether that user was already a participant or not.
- When a Jiyoba is thrown, another Jiyoba is given to a friend participant that is next on the list of recipients.
- A global list of potential Jiyoba recipients (all particpanta) is maintained and viewable, these last on the stack will receive a the jiyoba created when another Jiyoba is thrown.
- When there has been a Jiyoba created for each field, chapter two begins.
- A user that owns a stewardship for a field can retrieve any of the Jiyoba in that field.
- Each Jiyoba has a message list associated with it as well as a track log of all the fields it has been in.
- A user can register interest in a field to be notified when a jiyoba lands there.
- Stewards are notified when a Jiyoba lands in any of their fields
- Users are notified when a Jiyoba lands in their home base square
- Jiyoba have a chain of creation.
- Jioba start out life in a field 1 field away from their parent field.
- How many Jiyoba a user has caused to be created or has thrown is maintained.
- How many miles a user has thrown Jiyoba is maintained.
- A user can view the history of all Jiyoba ever thrown, or created but not those of Jiyoba given.
- When a user buys a field, 64 Jiyoba are created in it.

Amber's idea: Create jiyoba for each element.... 
              Chapter 2 gets the balls back home.
              Chapter 3 get the elements into alignment.

Users with satchels are masters of retrieval.
Users with on facebook are masters of the relationships.
Stewards are masters of the land.


TODO:
Make sure that queries for polygons or jiyoba return the correct quadrangles for fields spanning the prime meridian, equator and poles.
Make sure entailment method for geo quadrangles also wraps properly... make some unit tests.
